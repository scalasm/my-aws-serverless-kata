# Welcome to My AWS Serverless Kata project.

This is a project for learning and experimenting about serverless application patterns and best practices applied to the AWS world.

I use [AWS CDK](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/) as my infrastructure as code tool.

Everything, from the CDK App to Lambda functions, is done in Typescript for convenience - my focus is on architecture patterns, not really the language features. 

The `cdk.json` file tells the CDK Toolkit how to execute your app.

# Suggested toolbox

- Use Visual Studio Code plus AWS and Typescript extensions.
- NodeJS 18.x or newer
- ESLint for Typescript installed

# Useful reference

- [The CDK Book][https://www.thecdkbook.com/] is a mine of information.
- [CDK Patterns](https://cdkpatterns.com/) is a great public catalog of reusable CDK patterns for your designing your applications.
